pa_ppx_migrate Version 0.12
---------------------------

* [26 Apr 2024] Camlp5 8.03.00, OCaml 5.2.0 support

  latest ocaml has some typechecking changes; this required slightly
  changing the codegenerator for migrations.

  New syntax for "manual" migrations.  These are like any other
  migration, but are not automatically applied, so you can define one
  and then use it in the "code" and "custom_code" blocks of other
  migrations.
